  	<h2>Co-curriculum Activities</h2>
  	<h3>Young Enterprise Club (2014)<h3>
	<p>Microsoft skills: I need to create presentation slides to show my fellow team members and companies the problem that the community faced and how to resolve it.
	Collaborative/Teamwork: My team members need to brain storm ideas, creating prototype, encouraging each other to strive towards our year-end target sales. We won best product in the FedEx competition because it is very much relevant to the concept of reduce, reuse and recycle with a commercial product packaging.</p>

	<h3>Nepal Project (2016/2017)</h3>
	<p>Step out of the comfort zone: Starting an international charity project for a fresh high school graduate was not very easy. Establishing local contact in Nepal is the hardest as I have no connections and finding a trustable organisation is crucial spending months calling up organisations and each have different objectives and requirements, hence I need to prioritise and think of my objectives making decision carefully.
	Leadership skills: Team member have different views and opinions in doing things, as a project manager deciding which sides to take was important and not hurting other members feelings. Keep encouraging them to move towards our target and ensure no one falls of the train.</p>

	<h3>UoL Buda Society (2019/2020)</h3>
	<p> Buddhist training allows for a deep transformation in the heart, allowing us to realize the truth of the Buddhaâ€™s words. With this realization comes the development of good will, compassion, joy and serenity; as well as peace of heart and a willingness to be of use. Humanistic Buddhism encourage me to use His Wisdom to apply in it real life whenever I face difficulties, also practicing meditation allows me to sharpen my mind and being focus. </p>
